# branch
## About branch operation
Basically, I want you to create it from `develop` with `feature/{issue number}`
Example: `feature/1`, `feature/5`
`main` is planned to be merged from `develop` when released.
  
### If the same branch name already exists
I would like you to add `_` and respond each time like `feature/1_`
  
## About commit messages
I would appreciate it if you could write a message like `#{issue number} content` so that I can link it to the issue.
Example: `#1 ReadMe update`
  
# others
I feel like everyone does it when they have free time, so I don't think it's okay to have that much of a sense of mission.
